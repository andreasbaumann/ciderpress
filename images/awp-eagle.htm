<p><b>View documents and graphics</b>.&nbsp; The above are file viewer windows
from two instances of CiderPress.&nbsp; The first is viewing a 3200-color image
of an eagle, using the full palette of the original.&nbsp; The second is an
AppleWorks 3.0 word processor document, converted for use in Windows.&nbsp; CiderPress supports many AWP formatting commands, including left
and right margins, text justification, and text face changes such as bold,
underlined, and
superscripted text.</p>
<p>You can extract files in their original form or in converted form.&nbsp; The
eagle image extracts as a Windows BMP file, ready for use in any application
that handles graphics.&nbsp; The AWP document extracts in Rich Text Format
(.rtf), ready for use in most word processors.&nbsp; Both can be cut &amp;
pasted directly from the file viewer, or sent to a printer with the
&quot;Print&quot; button.&nbsp; You can even change fonts.</p>
